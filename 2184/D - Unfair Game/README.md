Bob has thought of a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where it is known that $$$n = 2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer $$$d$$$. Initially, Alice <span class="tex-font-style-bf">knows</span> whether the chosen number is even or not. </p><p>In one move, Alice can either halve the number or subtract $$$1$$$. Alice can only halve the number if the current number is even. Only Alice takes turns. </p><p>After her move, Alice receives a response from Bob: either $$$-1$$$, which means the number has become $$$0$$$ and Alice has won, or a non-negative integer $$$x$$$. If we denote the current number as $$$a$$$, then for $$$x$$$ the following conditions hold simultaneously:</p><ol> <li> $$$a$$$ is divisible by $$$2^x$$$. </li><li> $$$a$$$ is not divisible by $$$2^{x+1}$$$. </li></ol><p>For example, if $$$a=5$$$, then $$$x=0$$$, since $$$5$$$ is divisible by $$$2^0=1$$$ and not divisible by $$$2^1=2$$$, and if $$$a=12$$$, then $$$x=2$$$, since $$$12$$$ is divisible by $$$2^2=4$$$ and not divisible by $$$2^3=8$$$.</p><p>It can be shown that for any integer $$$a > 0$$$, there exists a unique such $$$x$$$.</p><p>Bob is still afraid that Alice will win, so the game will have no more than $$$k$$$ moves. Additionally, Bob wants to maximize his chances of winning, so he wants to play as many games as possible. Given $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, calculate the number of initial numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that Alice, playing optimally, cannot win in no more than $$$k$$$ moves.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \le n, k \le 10^9)$$$ — the limit on the chosen number and the maximum number of Alice's moves, respectively. It is guaranteed that $$$n = 2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer $$$d$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, output the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that Alice, playing optimally, cannot win in at most $$$k$$$ moves.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id006240566042672702" id="id0004641523083453469" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id006240566042672702"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-0">7</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">4 1</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">4 2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">4 3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">4 4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-5">4 5</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-6">16 5</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-7">16 1</div></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id006553660872844657" id="id008086785539673311" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id006553660872844657"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">0</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">0</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-5">0</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-6">4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-7">15</div></pre></div></div></div><div class="note"><div class="section-title">Note</div><p>In the first sample, $$$a=2$$$, $$$a=3$$$, and $$$a=4$$$ are suitable because from $$$a=1$$$ one can reach $$$0$$$ in $$$1$$$ operation, while for the other values, it can be shown that at least $$$2$$$ operations are required.</p><p>In the second sample, $$$a=3$$$ and $$$a=4$$$ are suitable because for $$$a=2$$$, Alice can win in $$$2$$$ operations.</p><p>In the third, fourth, and fifth samples, there are no suitable $$$a$$$, because for $$$a=3$$$ and $$$a=4$$$, Alice can win in $$$3$$$ operations.</p></div>
